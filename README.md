# Dijkstra-s-shortest-path-algorithm-GUI-
 Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.   The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest path tree. CODE: In the code, we create two classes: Graph, which holds the master list of vertices, and Vertex, which represents each vertex in the graph.  The source file is welcome.py. The function Dijkstra() calculates the shortest path.  Softwareâ€™s used :  PAGE: It is a cross-platform drag-and-drop GUI generator, bearing a resemblance to Visual Basic. It allows one to easily create GUI windows containing a selection of Tk and ttk widgets. PAGE is not an end-all, be-all tool, but rather one that attempts to ease the burden on the Python programmer. It is aimed at the user who will put up with a less than completely general GUI capability in order to get an easily generated GUI. A helper and learning tool, it does not build an entire application but rather is aimed at building a single GUI class and the boiler plate code in Python necessary for getting the GUI on the screen. PYCHARM: is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language.
